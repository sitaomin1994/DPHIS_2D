## Evaluation of Differeentially private 2D histogram publishing algorithms

This project is to evaluate the 2D histogram publishing algorithms

### Project structure:
- Algorithm: all algorithms
- Result: result of evalutation
- data_generator.py - to generate synthetic dataset
- evaluation.py - contains evaluation metrics
- experiment.py - pipeline to run experiment
- make_plot.py - functions to generate plot
- main.py - main program to run whole experiment

### Algorithms
- Identity
- Uniform
- Uniform Grids
- Adaptive Grids
- Quad tree (uniform, geometric, leaf)
- K-D tree (uniform, geometric, leaf, cell-based)
- Homogenous Tree (HTF)
